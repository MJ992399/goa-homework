    <h1><b>Colosseum</b></h1>
    <p><h3>The Colosseum in Rome, Italy, is the largest amphitheater built in human history and is composed mainly of concrete, limestone, and wood. Emperor Vespasian, who wanted a space for Romans to seek entertainment, ordered the construction. This construction began around 72 CE and was completed in 80 CE. The Colosseum, at 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters), could seat up to 50,000 viewers. Most events in The Colosseum were violent in nature, largely consisting of gladiator fights, public executions, and animal hunts. Between gladiators, prisoners, slaves, convicts, and other entertainers, an estimated 400,000 people died during the 350 years in which The Colosseum hosted events. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. Over 4 million people visit The Colosseum annually.</h3></p>
