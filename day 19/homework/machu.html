    <h1><u>machu picchu</u></h1>
    <p><h3>Machu Picchu is an Incan ancient ruins site located in the Andes Mountains, near the city of Cusco, Peru. Built in approximately 1450 CE, the Incans used very impressive drystone techniques, snuggly fitting together jagged stones like jigsaw pieces. Thanks to this intricate building technique, many of the structures continue to stand to this day. Peruvian farmer Agustín Lizárraga was the first recorded individual to discover Machu Picchu in 1902. However, Herman Bingham brought it to the attention of the Western world in 1911 with his discovery of it. There are many theories about the reasons for Machu Picchu’s construction. Some scholars believe that Machu Picchu was a holy convent known as “Virgins of the Sun” for women who were dedicated to the Incan sun god, Inti. Other theories include the city being a royal retreat for the Emporer Pachacuti or being a trading hub or location to test new crops. In 1983, Machu Picchu became a UNESCO World Heritage site, and today, approximately 1.5 million people visit it each year.</h3></p>
